BETTING PATTERNS AND BET SIZING GUIDE
=====================================

VALUE BETTING:
--------------
Goal: Get called by worse hands
Sizing: 60-80% of pot
When: You have a strong hand that's likely best

Examples:
- Top pair with good kicker on dry board: 65% pot
- Two pair or better: 75% pot  
- Nuts or near-nuts: 80% pot

BLUFFING:
---------
Goal: Make better hands fold
Sizing: 60-100% of pot (larger = more fold equity)
When: You have little showdown value but fold equity

Examples:
- Missed draw on river: 70% pot
- Complete air on scary board: 80% pot
- Semi-bluff with draws: 60% pot

CONTINUATION BETTING (C-BET):
-----------------------------
Goal: Win pot immediately or build pot with strong hands
Sizing: 40-70% of pot depending on board texture

DRY BOARDS (A-7-2 rainbow): 40-50% pot
- Opponents miss often
- Small sizing gets folds from air

WET BOARDS (9-8-7 two-tone): 65-75% pot  
- Need to charge draws
- Protect your equity

POSITION AND BET SIZING:
------------------------

IN POSITION:
- Can bet smaller for value (opponents can't raise easily)
- Can bluff smaller (have more streets to apply pressure)
- Generally 50-70% pot sizing

OUT OF POSITION:
- Need larger sizing to prevent being outplayed
- Must charge premium for position disadvantage
- Generally 65-85% pot sizing

OPPONENT TYPE ADJUSTMENTS:
--------------------------

TIGHT OPPONENTS:
- Value bet smaller (they won't call big bets light)
- Bluff more often (they fold too much)
- Can get away with 50-60% pot sizing

LOOSE OPPONENTS:
- Value bet larger (they'll call with weak hands)
- Bluff less often (they don't fold enough)
- Use 70-90% pot sizing for value

STACK DEPTH CONSIDERATIONS:
---------------------------

DEEP STACKS (100bb+):
- Can use smaller sizing early
- Build pot gradually with strong hands
- More room for complex strategies

SHORT STACKS (<40bb):
- Use polarized sizing (small or all-in)
- Get stacks in quickly with strong hands
- Less room for multi-street play

COMMON BET SIZING MISTAKES:
---------------------------

TOO SMALL:
- Doesn't build pot with strong hands
- Gives opponents great odds to call
- Allows draws to see cards cheaply

TOO LARGE:
- Gets called only by better hands
- Bloats pot with marginal holdings
- Commits too much with weak hands

INCONSISTENT:
- Bet sizing tells (small=bluff, large=value)
- Opponents can exploit patterns
- Should vary sizing by situation, not hand strength

ADVANCED CONCEPTS:
------------------

POLARIZED RANGES:
- Bet large with very strong hands and bluffs
- Check with medium-strength hands
- Forces difficult decisions

MERGED RANGES:
- Bet medium size with wide range of hands
- Balanced between value and bluffs
- Harder for opponents to exploit

OVERBETTING:
- Betting more than pot size
- Puts maximum pressure on opponents
- Use with nuts or as pure bluff
